# HoneyDrive

HoneyDrive encourages safe driving by collecting, analyzing and displaying data about the
driver’s behavior on the road. Historical data about acceleration, braking, speed and distance
driven is broadcast to insurance companies, ensuring up­to­date premiums. The same data is
visualized to encourage safe and environmentally friendly driving, augmented by gamification.
